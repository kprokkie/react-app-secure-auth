# Securing React Apps with Auth0
AUTHORIZATION AND AUTHENTICATION STANDARDS

## OAuth
- Authorization protocol
- Authorize a user without their password
- Get info from a third party


## Sign up for Auth0

Key decisions
- OAuth Flow
- Login/Signup integration
- Create Auth0 app
- Configure .env vars

## Implicit Flow
1. Your app directs the browser to the Auth0 sign-in
2. Auth0 redirects to your app, at the callback URL you chose
3. Your app reads the tokens from the URL
